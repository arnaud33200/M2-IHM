Ivy is a software bus initially initially designed at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cena.fr/" target="_top">CENA</a>.  A software bus is a system that
allows software applications to exchange information with the illusion of
broadcasting that information, selection being performed by the receiving
applications. Using a software bus is very similar to dealing with events in a
graphical toolkit: on one side, messages are emitted without caring about who
will handle them, and on the other side, one decide to handle the messages
that have a certain type or follow a certain pattern. Software buses are
mainly aimed at facilitating the rapid development of new agents, and at
managing a dynamic collection of agents on the bus: agents show up, emit
messages and receive some, then leave the bus without blocking the others.

Ivy is implemented as a collection of libraries for several languages and
platforms. If you want to read more about the principles Ivy before reading
this guide of the Java 
library, please refer to <em class="citetitle">The Ivy software bus: a white
paper</em>
            . If you want more details about the internals of Ivy, have a
look at <em class="citetitle">The Ivy architecture and protocol</em>
            . And finally,
if you are more interested in other languages, refer to other guides such as
<em class="citetitle">The Ivy Perl library guide</em>
             (not yet written), or
<em class="citetitle">The Ivy C library guide</em>
            . All those documents should be available from <a class="ulink" href="http://www2.tls.cena.fr/products/ivy/" target="_top">the Ivy Web site </a>
